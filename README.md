A complete solution for generating realistic talking avatars with your choice of Wav2Lip (local processing) or D-ID (cloud API).

‚ú® Features

- Dual Generation Engines
  - üöÄ Wav2Lip for fast local processing (Slow, Results vary based on the checkpoint and training model)
  - ‚ú® D-ID for studio-quality results (High-Quality, but you need to have Credits to generate the video, if not then your video will have watermarks)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Voice customization (pitch/speed control)
- Web-based interface

üõ† Installation

Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg
- GPU (Recommended for Wav2Lip)

Place the Model Check file wav2lip in your root folder, you can download from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C6mr4VypvMWQvwyv06RhBcUW1ax0aapw/view?usp=sharing
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lewisitor/facialtts.git
cd avatar

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Install Python requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

‚öô Configuration

1. Create `.env` file in root directory:

```ini
# D-ID Configuration
D_ID_API_KEY=your_d-id_api_key_here
D_ID_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.d-id.com/talks

# Wav2Lip Configuration
WAV2LIP_CHECKPOINT=./Wav2Lip.pth # you will need to download the checkpoint file if you want to use Wav2Lip
For WAV2LIP I used code from the repo of Wav2Lip: https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip
# Google TTS
Google_TTS_API_KEY=your_google_cloud_key

# Python
PYTHON_PATH=./Wav2Lip/env/env/bin/python

# File Directory Structure
FILE_DIR_PATH=your_directory_path
YOUR_SERVER_URL=your_server_url


```

üöÄ Usage

```bash
# Start development server - you can use nodemon server.js
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

Access the web interface at: `http://localhost:5200`

For cloud deployment you will need to create your own server.crt, server.csr, server.key for your public and private SSL certificate

üìö API Endpoints

Generate Video
`POST /api/generate`
```json
{
  "avatar": "uploads/images/image.jpg",
  "audio": "uploads/audio/audio.mp3",
  "provider": "wav2lip|did"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "videoUrl": "uploads/videos/video.mp4",
  "metadata": {
    "provider": "wav2lip",
    "processingTime": "45s"
  }
}
```

A cache is needed to process the video, this is a requirement from DID
I enabled Localstorage to act as a cache, you can also use Redis.
